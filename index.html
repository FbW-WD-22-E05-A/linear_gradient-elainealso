        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>
          Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe. It is the second-largest
          European country, covering approximately 600,000 square kilometres
          (230,000 sq mi), and has a population of around 40 million people.
          It is bordered by Russia to the east and northeast; by Belarus to
          the north; by Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; and by
          Romania and Moldova to the southwest; with a coastline along the
          Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the south and southeast,
          respectively. Kyiv is Ukraine's capital as well as its largest city.
          The country's language is Ukrainian, and many people are also fluent
          in Russian. During the Middle Ages, the area was a key centre of
          East Slavic culture under the state of Kievan Rus', which emerged in
          the 9th century and was destroyed by a Mongol invasion in the 13th
          century. Over the next 600 years, the area was contested, divided,
          and ruled by a variety of external powers, including the
          Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Austrian Empire, the Ottoman
          Empire, and the Tsardom of Russia. The Cossack Hetmanate emerged in
          central Ukraine in the 17th century, but was partitioned between
          Russia and Poland, and ultimately completely into the Russian
          Empire. Ukrainian nationalism grew in the 19th century, particularly
          in Galicia, a kingdom within Austria-Hungary. In the aftermath of
          the Russian Revolution, a Ukrainian national movement re-emerged,
          and formed the Ukrainian People's Republic in 1917. This short-lived
          state was forcibly reconstituted by the Bolsheviks into the
          Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a founding member
          of the Soviet Union in 1922. In the 1930s, millions of Ukrainians
          were killed by the Holodomor, a man-made famine of the Stalinist
          era. In 1939, with the secret agreement of Nazi Germany, the Soviet
          Union invaded and annexed lands with predominant Ukrainian
          population from Poland to western Ukraine. Between 1922 and 1991,
          Ukraine was the most populous and industrialized Soviet republic
          after Russia.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Settlement by modern humans in Ukraine and its vicinity dates back
          to 32,000 BC, with evidence of the Gravettian culture in the Crimean
          Mountains. By 4,500 BC, the Neolithic Cucuteni–Trypillia culture was
          flourishing in wide areas of modern Ukraine, including Trypillia and
          the entire Dnieper-Dniester region. Ukraine is also considered to be
          the likely location of the first domestication of the horse. During
          the Iron Age, the land was inhabited by Cimmerians, Scythians, and
          Sarmatians. Between 700 BC and 200 BC it was part of the Scythian
          kingdom.From the 6th century BC, Greek, Roman, and Byzantine
          colonies were established on the north-eastern shore of the Black
          Sea, such as at Tyras, Olbia, and Chersonesus. These thrived into
          the 6th century AD. The Goths stayed in the area, but came under the
          sway of the Huns from the 370s. In the 7th century, the territory
          that is now eastern Ukraine was the centre of Old Great Bulgaria. At
          the end of the century, the majority of Bulgar tribes migrated in
          different directions, and the Khazars took over much of the land.In
          the 5th and 6th centuries, the Early Slavic, Antes people lived in
          Ukraine. The Antes were the ancestors of Ukrainians: White Croats,
          Severians, Eastern Polans, Drevlyans, Dulebes, Ulichians, and
          Tiverians. Migrations from the territories of present-day Ukraine
          throughout the Balkans established many South Slavic nations.
          Northern migrations, reaching almost to Lake Ilmen, led to the
          emergence of the Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs, and Radimichs, the groups
          ancestral to the Russians. Following an Avar raid in 602 and the
          collapse of the Antes Union, most of these peoples survived as
          separate tribes until the beginning of the second millennium.

        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>
          Ukraine is the second-largest European country, after Russia. Lying
          between latitudes 44° and 53° N, and longitudes 22° and 41° E., it
          is mostly in the East European Plain. Ukraine covers an area of
          603,628 square kilometres (233,062 sq mi), with a coastline of 2,782
          kilometres (1,729 mi).The landscape of Ukraine consists mostly of
          fertile plains (or steppes) and plateaus, crossed by rivers such as
          the Dnieper (Dnipro), Seversky Donets, Dniester and the Southern Bug
          as they flow south into the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov.
          To the southwest, the delta of the Danube forms the border with
          Romania. Ukraine's various regions have diverse geographic features
          ranging from the highlands to the lowlands. The country's only
          mountains are the Carpathian Mountains in the west, of which the
          highest is Hoverla at 2,061 metres (6,762 ft), and the Crimean
          Mountains, in the extreme south along the coast.Ukraine also has a
          number of highland regions such as the Volyn-Podillia Upland (in the
          west) and the Near-Dnipro Upland (on the right bank of Dnieper). To
          the east there are the south-western spurs of the Central Russian
          Upland over which runs the border with the Russian Federation. Near
          the Sea of Azov can be found the Donets Ridge and the Near Azov
          Upland. The snow melt from the mountains feeds the rivers and their
          waterfalls.Significant natural resources in Ukraine include lithium,
          natural gas, kaolin, timber and an abundance of arable land. Ukraine
          has many environmental issues. Some regions lack adequate supplies
          of potable water. Air and water pollution affects the country, as
          well as deforestation, and radiation contamination in the northeast
          stemming from the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power
          Plant.

        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>
          Ukraine has a mostly temperate climate, except for the southern
          coast of Crimea which has a subtropical climate. The climate is
          influenced by moderately warm, humid air from the Atlantic Ocean.
          Average annual temperatures range from 5.5–7 °C (41.9–44.6 °F) in
          the north, to 11–13 °C (51.8–55.4 °F) in the south. Precipitation is
          highest in the west and north and lowest in the east and southeast.
          Western Ukraine, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains, receives
          around 120 centimetres (47.2 in) of precipitation annually, while
          Crimea and the coastal areas of the Black Sea receive around 40
          centimetres (15.7 in).Water availability from the major river basins
          is expected to decrease due to climate change, especially in summer.
          This poses risks to the agricultural sector. The negative impacts of
          climate change on agriculture are mostly felt in the south of the
          country, which has a steppe climate. In the north, some crops may be
          able to benefit from a longer growing season. The World Bank has
          stated that Ukraine is highly vulnerable to climate change.
